## Tor configuration file for HTTP C2 Profile

# Define the location of the hidden service directory
# This directory will store the private key and hostname file
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/

# Redirect all traffic coming to the hidden service to the local port 9943
# This is where your HTTP listener will be listening inside the container
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9943

# Optional configurations:
# Increase logging for debugging (comment out in production)
# Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
# Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log

# It is important to restrict access to the Tor configuration and hidden service directory
# Ensure that only the Tor process and users with a need to know have access to these files

# Depending on your operational needs, you might want to fine-tune additional Tor settings
# For example, setting bandwidth limits, configuring entry/exit nodes, etc.
